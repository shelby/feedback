# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability
- Email `security@shelby.xyz` with *Security Report* in the subject line.
- Include affected product/service, version or commit, impact, reproduction steps, and any relevant logs or proof-of-concept.
- Please do **not** open public GitHub issues for security problems.

We monitor the security inbox on business days and will acknowledge new reports as quickly as we can. If you have not received a response within five business days, feel free to follow up on the same thread.

## Coordinated Disclosure
Once a report is validated, we will work with you to investigate, remediate, and coordinate disclosure. We may request additional information or a safe channel for sharing sensitive artifacts.

## Bug Bounty Status
We do not currently run a public bug bounty or offer monetary rewards. We still appreciate responsible disclosures and will credit researchers when possible.

## Additional Information
- Our current security.txt file lives at `https://shelby.xyz/security.txt`.
- For non-security issues (bugs, feature requests, questions), please continue to use the standard GitHub issue templates referenced in `README.md`.
