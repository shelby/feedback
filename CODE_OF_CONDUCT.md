# Shelby Community Code of Conduct

This document applies to all spaces managed by the Shelby team, including GitHub repositories, issue trackers, discussions, community chats, events, and any direct interactions stemming from these spaces. We are committed to providing a welcoming, inclusive, and safe environment for everyone who wants to participate in the Shelby ecosystem.

## Our Pledge
Members of the community—including maintainers, contributors, and participants—pledge to make participation in the project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

### Expected Behavior
- Demonstrate empathy and kindness toward other people.
- Respect differing opinions, experiences, and technical approaches.
- Give and gracefully accept constructive feedback.
- Accept responsibility and apologize to those affected by our mistakes, learning from the experience.
- Focus on what is best for the community and the project.

### Unacceptable Behavior
- Harassment, bullying, or discrimination in any form.
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
- Public or private harassment, including repeated unwelcome contact.
- Publishing the private information of others without explicit permission.
- Disruptions of community spaces, including sustained off-topic communication, spamming, or behavior that makes it difficult to meaningfully participate.
- Encouraging or condoning any of the behaviors above.

## Maintainer Responsibilities
- Clarify and enforce the standards of acceptable behavior.
- Respond promptly and respectfully to reports.
- Take appropriate and fair corrective action when unacceptable behavior is reported or observed.
- Keep reporter information confidential to the extent permitted by law and aligned with the reporter's wishes.
- Communicate reasons for moderation decisions when doing so does not compromise privacy or safety.

## Scope
This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, and when an individual is officially representing the project or community in public spaces. Examples include using an official project email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Reporting
- Email `conduct@shelby.xyz` with **Code of Conduct Report** in the subject line.
- Include the names (real, nicknames, or pseudonyms) of the individuals involved, a description of what happened, dates and times, and any additional context.
- If you are unsure whether an incident is a violation, we encourage you to report it. We would rather have more information than too little.
- Reports are reviewed by the Shelby Conduct Response team. If a member of that team is involved in the incident, they will recuse themselves from handling the report.

We will acknowledge new reports within five business days. If you have not received a response in that window, please send a follow-up on the same thread. We will keep you informed about the progress of the investigation to the extent we are able.

## Enforcement Guidelines
Community leaders will follow these guidelines when determining the consequences for any action they judge to be in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction
**Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome but believed to be unintentional.  
**Consequence**: Written warning outlining the breach and why behavior was inappropriate. The individual is expected to adjust behavior immediately.

### 2. Warning
**Impact**: A violation that had a noticeable impact on others, or repetition of behavior previously addressed.  
**Consequence**: A final warning with consequences for continued behavior. Additional conditions may be imposed (e.g., moderated participation) for a set period.

### 3. Temporary Suspension
**Impact**: Behavior that substantially disrupts community participation, includes sustained harassment, or threatens the safety of others.  
**Consequence**: Temporary suspension from interaction with the community, including repositories, chats, and events, for a defined period. Before reinstatement, the individual must commit to refraining from the relevant behavior.

### 4. Permanent Ban
**Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violations, retaliation against reporters, disclosure of private information, or behavior that endangers the safety or reputation of community members.  
**Consequence**: Permanent removal from community spaces and revocation of project roles or access.

## Appeals
If you feel a moderation decision was made in error, you may submit an appeal by replying to the original report thread with additional context or evidence. Appeals will be reviewed by community leaders not involved in the initial decision.

## Acknowledgements
This Code of Conduct is inspired by the policies used by the Node.js and Rust communities, the Contributor Covenant v2.1, and well-established moderation guidelines across open source projects.
